\begin{abstract}
Emergent behavior research in swarms has primarily been based on binary proximity sensors. This research has provided a list of emergent behaviors that can be expected from simple, evolving swarm systems. 
We base our research on the work outlined in Brown et al. \cite{c1}, which describes the process of discovering which emergent behaviors can occur given a limited capability model of a robot.
We plan to expand on their research by adding a color to each robot representing a heterogeneous `type', and changing the binary sensor to an N-bit sensor detecting the color of the visible robots where N is the total number of colors.
Our goal is to determine if, given this simple capability model, these robots can exhibit self-segregation based on their color.

\section{Introduction}
Swarm systems have a variety of applications which are starting to beginning to become possible with modern technology. Tasks such as construction, exploring, search and rescue. 
Often, these tasks are implemented by trying to create a set of rules to control a swarm, or predicting the behavior of a swarm given a set of rules. 
Brown et. al. take a different approach, instead asking "given a set of \emph{capabilities}, what are the possible emergent behaviors that can occur?". 
This is an important question as it provides a lower-bound for defining the required complexity for a robot in a swarm to observe a desired emergent behavior. 

In nature, the emergent behavior of ``self-segregation'' is often important for creating complex behaviors from heterogeneous structures. 
For example, cockroaches exhibit preferential aggregation based on their smell \cite{c2}.
Ants also exhibit a form of self-segregation when organizing their young - ant brood that require more attention or food are placed on the perimeter to allow for easy-access whereas ants that do not require attention are placed in the center. \cite{c3}.
Segregation is also present at the molecular level accounting for phenomena such as organ formation. 

Previous research has been done to model the segregation of robots based on role. 
One approach to this is to apply a ``differential adhesivity'' model where heterogeneous types of robots exhibit a different levels of adhesion and cohesion based on their type \cite{c4}.
This model takes inspiration from the mechanisms that allow cell types to self-segregate in biological systems. 
Other models have been created that determine if self-segregation is possible through limited capability models and simple `if-then-else' statements with a similar goal of defining a complexity lower-bound for self-segregation \cite{c5}.

We propose a solution to this problem using a capability model similar to Brown et. al. where each robot has a differential drive motor controlled by a shallow neural network. 
We augment that capability model of Brown et. al. by adding a `color' parameter to each robot, and changing the binary line-of-site sensor to an N-bit sensor reporting the color of the observed robot. 
Our goal is to determine whether a swarm of robots can develop self-segregation behavior based on this limited capability model.


\section{Proposed Work}
We propose a system using simple differential drive robots as described in Brown et al. \cite{c1} and shown in Fig. \ref{bot_fig}, but with the added capabilities of sensing colors and defining their colors.
This color field for each robot will be implemented as a 1-hot encoded vector.
Initially, this color field will simply be a 2 bit vector as we will initially test just two groups of robots. 
The sensor will be adjusted to report an N-bit vector corresponding to the color of the robot seen. 
In the case that not robot is in the line of sight of the sensor, it will report a vector of all zeroes. 
To simplify the neural network, we will have collapse the input into 2 bits regardless of the number of classes in the simulation. 
The first bit will be a 1 if a robot of the same type is detected by the sensor, and the second bit will be a 1 if a robot of the second type is detected by the sensor. 
This new configuration can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:nnet}

\section{Proposed Experiments and Expected Outcomes}

    \caption{Novelty search as seen in \cite{c1}}
    \label{fig:alg}
\end{figure}


We will follow a similar construction to Brown et. al. to test our hypothesis. 
We will perform an evolutionary search over the possible neural network states and prioritize novel behaviors, as described in Figure~\ref{fig:alg}. 

Rather than clustering the observed statistics through unsupervised methods such as K-medoids, we will rank our observed behaviors using a measure of segregation, such as the intersection of convex hulls based on Santos et. al.~\cite{c6}.
The intersection of convex hulls summarizes the convex shape of each cluster of robots as a convex hull, and measures the overlap between the different classes.
This means that, if the classes are each perfectly separated, there will be no overlap between the nulls of each class, so the overlap will be zero. 

Once we can rank the models by their separation, we will visually inspect the top results to categorize their behavior and separation mechanisms. 

\section{Weekly Schedule}
To complete our objectives, we will have weekly meetings on both Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 6pm. At these meetings we will convene to review our progress over the past week and plan our work for the upcoming week. 
We set up a Gantt chart to plan our weekly progress, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gantt_chart}
